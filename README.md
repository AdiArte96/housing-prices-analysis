# Housing Prices Analysis

📊 A descriptive statistical analysis project focused on understanding what factors influence housing prices in the U.S. residential real estate market. This work was conducted as part of my MBA in Business Analytics at University Canada West.

## 📅 Project Details
- **Course**: BUSI 650 — Business Analytics
- **Date**: February 2024
- **Author**: Aditya Arte

## 📄 Overview
Using a 2014 dataset of U.S. housing prices, this project explores the relationship between various house features (bedrooms, bathrooms, area, city, condition, etc.) and pricing. The goal is to understand what makes houses expensive and provide actionable insights to buyers and real estate professionals.

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed
- Handled missing data and formatted the dataset
- Detected outliers using boxplots (for price and area)
- Calculated average, minimum, and maximum house prices
- Analyzed correlation and covariance between price and key features
- Created visualizations: scatter plots, bar charts, price distributions
- Identified city-wise average housing costs

## 📈 Results
- Strong correlation between **living area**, **bathrooms**, and **price**
- Prices tend to rise with better house conditions and more bedrooms
- Outlier properties skew the mean significantly (e.g., homes > $25M)
- Seasonal patterns suggest prices rise sharply in August

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Data Cleaning
- Boxplots & Scatterplots
- Descriptive Statistics
- Correlation & Covariance
